<h1>How to Download Mallet</h1>
MALLET can be downloaded at <http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php/>. 
There are instructions for installation on the page linked above. MALLET will be downloaded into your downloads folder. 
Once downloaded you should move the folder(which should be named mallet-2.0.8) onto your desktop. The next step will be 
transforming your XML files into a format that can be inputted into MALLET. 

Prior to Topic Modeling I woold advise having a corpus of of XML that can all be validated by a single schema(so that you
can write XSLT that can target the text that you want to analyze easily). MALLET cannot work with XML files; it only works
with an input of .txt documents. In order to save time you will use Oxygen to run a batch transformation on your XML files
in order to convert them all into indivdiual .txt files inside of a single directory.
